# ðŸ‘‹ Hey, I'm Tawfiq!

**I'm Tawfiq! Welcome to my corner of the internet!**

I'm a DevOps Engineer passionate about bridging development and operations. I enjoy automating infrastructure, optimizing CI/CD pipelines, and building scalable cloud solutions.

Currently diving deep into containerization with Docker and Kubernetes, infrastructure as code with Terraform, and cloud platforms like AWS. I love the challenge of making deployments seamless and systems more reliable.
