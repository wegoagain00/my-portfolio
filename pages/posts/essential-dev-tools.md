### Neovim (LazyVim)

All I have to say is wow, this is a massive change from VSCode. Long term, I can definitely see 
myself using Neovim as my main editor. The speed, the efficiency, and the customization options are 
just incredible. LazyVim has made it so easy to get started with Neovim, and I love how it integrates 
with all my other tools. It sounds scary but just go to lazyvim.org. Just be ready to be all keyboard 
and to be researching how to practically do everything in the terminal. In DevOps that's all you will 
be in anyway..

### Notion

Hands down the best tool for organizing my thoughts, projects, and notes. Notion's flexibility allows 
me to create databases, wikis, and task lists all in one place. It's become my go to for project 
management and personal organization. I use it to keep track of my blog posts, Devops Learning & 
Projects, and even my daily tasks.

### TUI (LazyGit and LazyDocker)

These terminal-based user interfaces have transformed how I interact with Git and Docker. LazyGit 
provides a simple and intuitive way to manage Git repositories, while LazyDocker offers a similar 
experience for Docker containers. Both tools are incredibly efficient and save me a lot of time 
compared to using the command line directly. LazyGit integrates with LazyVim, making it even more 
powerful. I can manage my Git repositories without leaving my editor, which is a huge productivity 
boost.

### Firefox

I'll have to say that Firefox is my go-to browser for development. Its developer tools are top-notch, 
and the ability to customize it with extensions like uBlock Origin and Privacy Badger makes it a 
great choice for privacy-conscious developers. I also love the Firefox DevTools, which provide 
powerful features for debugging and inspecting web applications. Can't forget the horizontal tab 
layout, which is a game changer for managing multiple tabs.

### Raycast(MacOS only)

Sometimes i rotate between linux and mac, for mac users, Raycast is a must-have productivity tool. It replaces Spotlight with a more powerful and customizable launcher. I use it to quickly access applications, files, and even run scripts. The ability to create custom commands and workflows has made my daily tasks much more efficient.
